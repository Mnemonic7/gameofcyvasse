##Background
Cyvasse is a game from Old Volantis oft mentioned in the book series [_A Song of Ice and Fire_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire). Played by lords, ladies, and commoners in the east. It has developed quite a following and has been used for everything from gambling to teaching wisdom to the young.

## The Board
The board consists of an 8 by 8 play area. Each half, referred to as a homeland, is an area of 8 by 4 and is separated at the start of the game by a screen providing sufficient cover so as each player cannot see the other's homeland.
During this phase each receives their tiles and may construct their homeland according the each of the tile attributes below.
### Tiles
#### Mountains
This tile is impassable to all units except Dragons.
Ranged units may attack Dragons that are on mountain tiles but they cannot attack through one.
Players may not exceed two mountains per row. This prevents mountains from being build into impassible walls.
#### Water
Water stops a unit's movement once they enter it.
That unit can not be moved next turn and must wait until that turn is passed.
Tebuchets, Catapaults, Crossbowmen can not attack while they are in this tile.
#### Forest
TBD
#### Grass
TBD


##The Units
There are 10 pieces, each with their own unique abilities. Each player receives one of each at the start of the game to place where they wish inside of their homeland.
